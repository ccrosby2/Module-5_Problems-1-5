#This program prints a statement if a range of numbers are divisible by 3 using their remainder value
#This progrom uses 3,5,and 15 to caluculate the range of numbers 1-50 remainder
#This program prints if a number is not divisble by 3, 5, and 15.

for x in range (1,50):
  if x % 15 == 0:
    print ("Divisible by both")
  elif x % 5 == 0:
    print ("Divisible by five")
  elif x % 3 == 0:
    print ("Divisible by three")
  else: 
    print(x)
